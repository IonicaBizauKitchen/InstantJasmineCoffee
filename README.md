# JasmineCoffee

*A [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ "CoffeeScript") skeleton project for test-driving with [Jasmine BDD](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ "Jasmine: BDD for Javascript | Jasmine")*

## Usage
Run the top-level script `watch-coffee-script.sh` to watch and compile any changes you make to your `test` and `production` code.

    $ ./watch-coffee-script.sh

That's it.  Hack away and run your test suite with `SpecRunner.html`.  There are some fun libraries included in the `lib` folder to play around with, too.

## More Info
